# Slint Rust Template

Rust application that's using [Slint](https://slint.rs/) for Finance Management App.

## About

I want to make an app, which allows you to calculate your expenses, including onetime purchases and monthly payments. 

## Usage (or Modifying)

1. Install Rust by following its [getting-started guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).
   Once this is done, you should have the `rustc` compiler and the `cargo` build system installed in your `PATH`. 
2. Build with `cargo`:
    ```
    cargo build
    ```
3. Run the application binary:
    ```
    cargo run
    ```
